In today’s digital-first world, users expect a smooth and secure online shopping experience.
While many large-scale platforms fulfill this demand, they often come with high costs and
complex configurations, making them less suitable for small businesses or student-led initiatives.
The objective of this project, titled QuickCart, is to address the need for a customizable and
lightweight e-commerce platform that provides essential features like product browsing, cart
management, order placement, and admin control—all without unnecessary complexity or
financial barriers
